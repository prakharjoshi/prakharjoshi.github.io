                    <p>After 10th, for me, IIT was my future life so I tried to achieve that for 3 years and learnt that life is more than the IIT. It was just a first step to enter the so called "TECHNICAL WORLD". Though I tried hard, I couldn't get in, instead got a seat in DAIICT. I was not that excited to be there at first as I had dreamed to be an IITian. But gradually I came to know that I was wrong. DA-IICT is a small,beautiful,peaceful campus at the capital of dry state of India. Even though it is in dry state it is in great demand in students :P.</p>
                    <p> I had never dreamed about being in IT field, I wanted to be mechanical or civil engineer at time when I was preparing for IIT. Finally I have to study IT for my college life. "CODING" is like the oxygen for this field. How would you survive if you don't like oxygen ? Weird it is. But that was the case with me in the starting few months of my college life. Coding was like a nightmare for me throughout the first year of my college. Actually I had never tried it seriously and patiently. So academically my first year was not that good but somehow I managed to get average grades.Afterwards I realised that if it continues this way, life might be miserable for me. Then I changed my vision about college, at first my vision about college was that its a place where you have fun only. NO,later I came to know about that with fun you have to do some technical or other stuff that will gonna help you in your future life.Then I had realized lately that as I am not fond of reading and writing so the only option left for me in that field was the so called Technical stuff.</p>
                    <p> But for that I had to love my nightmare. That seems to be quite impossible for me. But as I started working on it,initially I faced a lot of problems but as time passes they become habitual. We had been taught C,Java in first year but I rarely know about it :P. So I started working on python.It was fun for me working on it as I found it user friendly and quite simple language(not like C,java where you have to take care of syntax a lot). The most important thing about python is that its code contains quite few lines(as compared to C,java). What else I want in life :P. I got a way to live with my nightmare and that is python. As I studied more about python I came to know about that it is used in web development also.</p>
                    <p> I was quite excited after knowing that. Then came the word "DJANGO" again in my life for second time, first was the movie "Django unchained" :P. Then at the starting of my 4th semester in my college I started working on Django which is a webframe which uses python for making websites. But it was just the starting. At starting all things were like alien for me. At some point of time I though of leaving that but one of my seniors motivated me by saying that " अगर आसान होता तो सब ही कर लेते " and that sentence changed my thinking and it was a turning point in my life. I start working hard on Django, faced a lot of problem initially but now I am habitual to those things. When ever I felt demotivated I always remembered the lines said by that senior to me and it motivates me a lot.</p> 
                    <p> After 4 months of working on Django, I deployed my first web app. But that is just a start, a lot more to learn, a lot more to code, a lot more to debug and finally I am happy that I am also doing the so called "TECHNICAL STUFF". Really it feels great to do something different other that your usual curriculum. So I tried this and still working on it and now I can say that I am loving my nightmare. Well that is my first piece of writing, I have never written anything like blog or post before so I hope you enjoyed reading this as this is my experience of last few years of my life and I really thank my college and its people for what I am today. </p>
